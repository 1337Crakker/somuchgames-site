            will be taken from Your iTunes or Google Play account (“Account”) when You

            may cancel a subscription during its free trial period using the Subscription

            Fee cannot be taken from Your Account due to absence of monetary funds,
            invalidity of credit card or for any other reasons, Your Subscription is
            automatically cancelled. Once You have bought a Subscription, You can manage it

            notice of any change in Subscription Fee. If You do not take action to agree to
